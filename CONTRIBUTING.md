# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## Quick guidelines
- Keep changes focused and small when possible.
- Run the app locally and confirm behavior before submitting.
- Keep new files and scripts under version control only if they are necessary.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Make changes and test them.
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why.

## Notes
- Third-party models and large weights are stored in `third_party/` and should not be committed.
- Temporary runtime files live in `tmp/` and `logs/` and should not be committed.
